## Project progress Tracker

In our real-life scenario, we work in many projects or somehow involved in many projects, but in an undisciplined way. We do not maintain our workflow or keep tracks so we cannot see the project overview Or current state we’re in, team collaboration also done in a messy way. So, the project named ‘HAAPN’ helps us to create projects and associate individuals and distribute tasks or collaborate and keep track, all in one place
